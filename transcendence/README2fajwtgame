to make pythons virtual environment on mac or windows
For a more robust and manageable development environment, it is recommended to use virtual environments. They allow you to create isolated environments with specific versions of libraries needed for each project, avoiding conflicts.

You can create a virtual environment using venv (comes with Python):

Navigate to your project folder.

Run the following command:

bash

python -m venv myenv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash

myenv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash

source myenv/bin/activate
Once activated, you can install Django and other dependencies without polluting the global site-packages.

Ultimately, while running Django without a virtual environment is feasible, itâ€™s advisable to use one to ensure a smoother development experience and to prevent future issues.

to  ensure you collect static variables 
python manage.py collectstatic
before starting your server
